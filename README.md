# What's that?

That's the very start of react native application. Generally for studying purposes a small interactive shop is supposed to be soon

# Installation with terminal

To see it you can just load it in https://snack.expo.dev/@oxidit/animated-skeleton-loader
and I'll be constantly changeing that
 

# Currently supported functionality 
Functionality leaves much to be desired, I know, but I'm adding new functions and hopefully will finish this shop-template asap :smirk: 

When the app(if it can be called like that now) is open you'll see the following picture:

# Currently supported functionality

* Right now it only loads some data, but I'll be adding login form, basket and all shopping app functionality
 


# Terms and conditions.

Absolutely no any terms or conditions.
Please, feel free to use whatever you like :smile:
